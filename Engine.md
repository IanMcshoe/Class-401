**Discussion Questions**

- What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I bring myself! With all of my quirks and weird nuances. I also bring all of my experiences whether that be good or bad. I bring my curiosity and positive outlook at almost all situations. Most importantly is that i bring my previous failures and successes, that i continue to build off of. Noone can be me better than I can.
- What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

Reach out for help if I notice I'm in a lull of more than 15 minutes. Drink water and eat consistently. Remember to relax and rest, there have been many instances where a seemingly impossible task was solved immediately after a good nap.

## Things I want to know more about.

- Everything.
