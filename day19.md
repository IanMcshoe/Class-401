**Purely functional programming, from Wikipedia**

- In computer science, purely functional programming usually designates a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats all computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

**Language**

- A purely functional language is a language which only admits purely functional programming. Purely functional programs can however be written in languages which are not purely functional.

**Data Structures**

- Purely functional data structures are often represented in a different way than their imperative counterparts.[6] For example, array with constant-time access and update is a basic component of most imperative languages and many imperative data-structures, such as hash table and binary heap, are based on arrays. Arrays can be replaced by map or random access list, which admits purely functional implementation, but the access and update time is logarithmic.
