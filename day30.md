## Ethics in Tech

**Overview**

- The burden of knowledge is something that Alex brings up quite a bit, but what does it actually mean? Take project Dragonfly. Googles fabled search engine designed to censor the masses of Beijing. You may wonder what is wrong with making a search engine as requested but what precedent does it set for futeure projects? purposefully making a restricted window for the internet to keep a people supressed and in the dark cannot be allowed to become the new standard or we shall all be in the dark eventually.
- I have always though that we need to keep a long distance between private corporations and war. Big business should not be allowed to contribute to the decimation of a poeple for over 20 years. It's employees can't be given all the imformation or else I'm sure they wouldn't have contributed. Which begs the question is it lawful to be unwillingly forced to become a profiteer of war?
