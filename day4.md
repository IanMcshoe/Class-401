- Java OO Tutorial (only the Object and Class ones)

Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior. Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail). Bicycles also have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed) and behavior (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes). Identifying the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming.
- Java Classes (do NOT do the Nested Classes section)

A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.
- Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which. The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols. Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1. Hexadecimal numbers are interesting. There are 16 of them! They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.

## Things I want to know more about.

- Hashsets with loopy loops.
