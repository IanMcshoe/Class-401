# Bash Practice

**Command Line**

- The Command line is the tool that allows you to interact with your computers file system in a direct manner rather than using the file browser in windows.

**Basic Navigation**

- Learning to use basic commands to navigate arounf your system is life changing. I know that CD is my favorite thing now as long as you can remember the names you can get there. If you dont remember than just Tab. Your PC will help you out.

**Files**

- Knowing your file structure will save you a bunch of time. Ive especially found this to be true in java when trying to import outside libraries and having to manipulate your file paths.

**Manual Pages**

- You're only as good as what you know. Knowing how to access a resourse inside the command line that will teach you even more about what your are doing is very helpful.

**Files Etc**

- When I finally figured out how to appropriately mkdir and ls saved me so much grief. It helped find lost things and also create powerful directories with very few keys pressed.
