**Intro to password hashing**


- A strong password storage strategy is critical to mitigating data breaches that put the reputation of any organization in danger. Hashing is the foundation of secure password storage.

**bcrypt overview**


- Using a Key Factor, BCrypt is able to adjust the cost of hashing. With Key Factor changes, the hash output can be influenced. In this way, BCrypt remains extremely resistant to hacks, especially a type of password cracking called rainbow table.

**jBCrypt (the paragraphs and code example at the top of the page)**


- jBCrypt is a Java™ implementation of OpenBSD's Blowfish password hashing code, as described in "A Future-Adaptable Password Scheme" by Niels Provos and David Mazières.

This system hashes passwords using a version of Bruce Schneier's Blowfish block cipher with modifications designed to raise the cost of off-line password cracking and frustrate fast hardware implementation. The computation cost of the algorithm is parametised, so it can be increased as computers get faster. The intent is to make a compromise of a password database less likely to result in an attacker gaining knowledge of the plaintext passwords (e.g. using John the Ripper).

There seems to be a lack of good password hashes for Java - the top two hits in Google (as of 2006/05/24) for "Java password hash" and "Java password encryption" both offer terrible advice: one uses an unsalted hash which allows reverse dictionary lookup of passwords and the other recommends reversible encryption, which is rarely needed and should only be used as a last resort.
