## Intro to Serverless, AWS Amplify, GraphQL.

**Questions**

- What makes an API RESTful?

A client-server architecture made up of clients, servers, and resources, with requests managed through HTTP

- What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?

GraphQL's single greatest benefit is the developer experience it provides. It's straightforward to add new types and fields to your API, and similarly straightforward for your clients to begin using those fields. GraphQL is more complex than REST, and its main drawbacks include issues with error reporting, caching, and N+1
