**Trees**

**Fun Facts about Trees**

- A node that has no children is called a leaf. A leaf node can be recognized by the fact that both the left and right pointers in the node are null. In the standard picture of a binary tree, the root node is shown at the top and the leaf nodes at the bottomâ€”which doesn't show much respect for the analogy to real trees. But at least you can see the branching, tree-like structure that gives a binary tree its name.


- In a balanced binary tree the left and right branches of every item differ in height by no more than 1.


- In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all items in the last level are as far left as possible.


- In a full binary tree every item has either 0 or 2 children.


- In a perfect binary tree all interior items have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level. A perfect binary tree is also a full and complete binary tree.
