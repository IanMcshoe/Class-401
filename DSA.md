# Data Structures and Algorithms

**Discussion Questions**

- What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

You would need to take into account what kind of data you are using. You will also need to know how often you will need to access this data.
- How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

You need to have an effectively written Recursion algorithm. That way when you reach the intended endpoint, the program stops.
## Things I want to know more about.

- Everything.
