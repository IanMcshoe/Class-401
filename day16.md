### Questions

- What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.

An intent is to perform an action on the screen. You could use it to take a picture or view a map depending on the app.
- describe an Activity in your own word.

It sounds to me like a SPA in a way. It's the entry point of an app that greets the user. a single screen with a user interface.

## Things I want to know more about.

- Android and more.
